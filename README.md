Installation & Configuration
============================
Cenni requires python 3.x

1. Run ./cenni - this creates a default config file
2. Edit ~/Cenni/config/default.py
3. Run ./cenni - this now runs cenni with your settings

Enjoy!

P.S: You'll encounter a number of missing dependencies upon first run. Feel free to install them via pip

To see a list of bot commands see the COMMANDS.md file.
